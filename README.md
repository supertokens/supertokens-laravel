# This repository only works with core version <= 2.5, and only for session management. 

- We are working on a newer php repo which will contain session and login functionality.
- If you would still like to use this, please download core version 2.5.
- If you want to use the managed service along with this repo, please [contact us](mailto:rishabh@supertokens.io) requesting us to deploy an older core version.

See more info about the compatibilty of this SDK with the core and frontend SDKs [on the comptibility table page](https://supertokens.io/docs/community/compatibility-table).
